# Reversi Project
# Group Arnaud Goguel, Flavien Pechere, Hadrien Vinay

In this document, we can find two versions of our project : 
	one offline part where you can play with a graphical interactions with allegro 4.2
	one online part where we are the game player: 
		we connect to the server
		we receive and send message
		we display the matrix we received
		we send x,y move of our player
	
And a video of our project working

We have some difficulties with the gameMaster and the gameController so we could't be connected with them
In simulation, we can receive a virtual message and update our matrix in function.
We also implemented the game functions and 3levels of Ia to play against.
